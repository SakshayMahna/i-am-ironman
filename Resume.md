## Summary

Robotics Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience working on ROS 2 tools, simulation, and system level debugging. At MathWorks, I have contributed to projects involving flight log analysis, vehicle simulation, and collaborative outreach with education and ROS teams. I created LaunchMap, a visualizer for ROS 2 launch files, and have made open-source contributions to Navigation2. I enjoy building tools that help others work more efficiently and am always looking to learn, collaborate, and improve systems through thoughtful design and feedback.

## Experience

### Engineer II | Robotics & Simulation
*MathWorks | 2024 – Present*

* Own the *[flight log analysis pipeline](https://www.mathworks.com/help/uav/flight-log-analysis.html)* for PX4/ArduPilot, designing a scalable architecture that supports extensible parser modules and distributed batch processing of flight logs.
* Collaborated with UX engineers to gather requirements from customers and mentored junior engineers on building the log visualization interface.
* Took ownership of the Unreal Engine simulation codebase to support *[off-road vehicle simulation](https://www.mathworks.com/solutions/robotics/offroad-vehicles.html)*, stepping in due to limited team capacity.

### Engineer I | Engineering Development Group
*MathWorks | 2022 – 2024*

* Developed a Gazebo based fruit picking simulation with modular components for perception (YOLO), planning (RRT), collision checking (Octotree), and actuation (gripper plugin). *[Link](https://www.mathworks.com/help/robotics/ug/detect-and-harvest-fruit-using-ur10-manipulator-in-gazebo.html)*
* Simulated LiDAR motion distortion using velocity based mathematical models to enable realistic sensing for moving vehicles. *[Link](https://www.mathworks.com/help/lidar/ref/lidarsensor-system-object.html)*
* Redesigned the robot model build process by decoupling the build using CMake, achieving a 40% reduction in build time.
* Worked with Education Marketing to test the Minidrone kit for student competitions and delivered a techincal session to Robocon teams on using Simulink for robot simulation.
* Delivered a talk at ROSCon India 2023 on "Integrating Custom Simulators with ROS" showcasing how MATLAB can interface with ROS based simulations; collaborated with the ROS and Marketing teams on content and delivery. *[Link](https://youtu.be/z_TDmEBpaqA?si=g-CWYVYG0IocM8lI)*

### Research Intern | Motion Planning Tools
*ARTPARK, IISc | May – July 2021 | [Link](https://youtube.com/shorts/kPZqT12bLj4?si=aQuSPhIEuv6Q8rzT)*
* Built a GUI tool for benchmarking MPC vs. Frenet trajectory planners.
* Automated simulations over MovingAI datasets using Streamlit and NumPy.

### GSoC Contributor | ROS Simulation Framework
*JdeRobot | May – Aug 2020*
* Re-architected the simulation framework using WebSockets, noVNC, Docker, and ROS. *[Link](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy)*
* Built an evolutionary robotics API using NumPy. *[Link](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2020-Sakshay_Mahna)*
* Delivered a lightning talk at ROSWorld 2020. *[Link](https://youtu.be/ThksY9hBYyk?si=rvTu6JasdtB5R8qZ)*

## Projects

### LaunchMap | ROS 2 Launch File Visualizer
*Personal Project | 2024 - Present* | *[Link](https://github.com/Kodo-Robotics/launchmap)*
* Built a recursive parser and registry based handler system to introspect complex ROS 2 launch files, including nested includes, event handlers, and unresolved LaunchConfigurations.
* Designed a resolution engine to track variable usage and visualize dynamic launch structures; frontend built with JavaScript for draggable, interactive graph layout.
* Collaborated with early users to refine core features based on real world debugging needs; actively promoting the tool in the ROS community through LinkedIn posts and discussions.
* Mentored new contributors by maintaining a modular architecture, clear issue tracking, and following contribution guidelines.

### Navigation2 | Open Source Contribution
*Personal Project | 2024 - Present* | *[Link](https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2/issues/4865)*
* Contributing to improvements in the Graceful Controller by implementing trajectory interpolation for smoother path tracking; based on understanding of the original paper and codebase.
* Followed Nav2's contribution guidelines, collaborated with maintainer, and resolved the merge issues during the pull request process.

### Modular URDF Generator | Research Project
*IIT Ropar | 2020 - 2021* | *[Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344992077_URDF_Generator_for_Unconventional_Modular_Reconfigurable_Manipulators)*
* Developed a modular library of robot links and joints for dynamically assembling URDFs tailored to task requirements; integrated with ROS for visualization, kinematics, motion planning, and control.
* Work presented at ReMAR 2021 (conference talk) and RISMSAS 2020 (lightning talk).

### YouTube Channel | Robotics with Sakshay
*Personal Project | 2020 - 2021* | *[Link](https://www.youtube.com/@RoboticswithSakshay)*
* Created educational content explaining robot manipulation theory, motion planning, perception, ROS and Game AI concepts for robotics learners.
* Delivered two live webinars on *Getting Started with ROS* and *Python for AI*.
* Contributed a playlist on *Perception for Self Driving Cars* to FreeCodeCamp's YouTube channel.
